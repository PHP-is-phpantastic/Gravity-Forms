# Gravity-Forms
I used Gravity Forms plugin and the related Addons for many clients .  


Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin that allows developers to create forms. Gravity Forms can be used for contact forms, WordPress post creation, calculators, employment applications and more. 

Many of my clients wanted GF integrated into their websites.
Note: Few Addons in this Repo are customized for clients.
